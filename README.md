Basic Restaurant Reservation System with CSV File Handling
This is a command-line application designed to manage restaurant reservations efficiently using a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue system. It allows restaurant staff to add, view, update, and cancel reservations while ensuring that all data is persistently stored in a CSV file. The system processes reservations by maintaining customer details, party size, and reservation time. It loads reservations from a CSV file on startup and saves updates automatically, ensuring data integrity across sessions.
